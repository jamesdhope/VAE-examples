# Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for MNIST

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for the MNIST dataset. The VAE is a generative model that learns to encode input data into a latent space and decode it back to the original space.

## Installation

To run this code, you need to have Python and PyTorch installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vae-mnist.git
    cd vae-mnist
    ```

2. Run the script to train the VAE:
    ```bash
    python train_vae.py
    ```

## Model Architecture

The VAE consists of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder.

### Encoder

The encoder maps the input data to a latent space. It consists of:
- A fully connected layer that transforms the input to a hidden dimension.
- Two fully connected layers that output the mean (`mu`) and log variance (`logvar`) of the latent space.

### Decoder

The decoder reconstructs the input data from the latent space. It consists of:
- A fully connected layer that transforms the latent space to a hidden dimension.
- A fully connected layer that outputs the reconstructed data.

### VAE

The VAE combines the encoder and decoder. It also includes a reparameterization step to sample from the latent space.

## Training

The training loop involves the following steps:

1. Load the MNIST dataset.
2. Initialize the VAE model and the optimizer.
3. For each epoch:
    - For each batch of data:
        - Flatten the input data.
        - Perform a forward pass through the model.
        - Compute the loss (Binary Cross Entropy + Kullback-Leibler Divergence).
        - Perform backpropagation and update the model parameters.
    - Print the average loss for the epoch.

## Saving the Model

After training, the model's state dictionary is saved to a file named `vae.pth`.
